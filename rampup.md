# Ramp up

Guidelines for the busy season

##  Introduction

Since the ramp up to the busy season is now happening, I need to make sure that my expectations are made clear and easily attainable. I will break things down by category and organize them based on how they come up in the process. I will explain further what needs to be done in an organized and hopefully descriptive manner.

### Expectations

I expect that we will maintain and enforce busy season rules as we approach the busy season
Those rules being:
- color coded orders
- marking reorders as urgent
- marking reprints
- communicating expectations to the next stages
- being on time to your shift
- managing your time efficiently
 
### Timeliness

I expect you to show up on time and ready to work. I don't expect you to start printing right away, but within ten minutes of starting your shift (given there are printable orders in your queue).

### Queue

Your print queue is the printing stage on NetSuite, The reprint requests in the #reprints Slack channel and the banner requests in Jira.
I expect you to follow that order when looking for things to print.

### Order priority within NetSuite is as follows:

- Reorders
- Store orders
- Incentive/OTK and OTF
  
### Identifying orders

Reorders should always go in orange envelopes.
Orange sticky should also be attached especially in the case when a note needs to be attached by the printer (us).
Store orders will go in the yellow-green envelopes. Nothing else needs to be attached to identify them.
Incentive/OTK orders will go in the blue envelopes with no other identifiers.
OTF will go in green envelopes with no other identifiers.
Orders that have escalated priority should receive orange sticky notes. Reorders should skip to the front of the line normally. But if you have been told that a standard order needs to be prioritized it should get an orange sticky note declaring the urgency. But if the order needs to be shipped faster, it should go in an orange envelope with a note saying that the order needs to be shipped expedited.

When sheets come off the printers, be sure to label sheets by priority. We want to make sure that the weeding and masking stage knows what to do with the sheets and paperwork.
Sheets that need to be labeled are sheets that don't have any corresponding identifiying paperwork:

    - Press reprints
    - Weeding reprints
    - urgent prints for reorders
    - Logos that need to go to a specific table/person

Marking sheets should be done in a clear and concise way so that the weeding and masking team will know what to do with it.

## Communication

### With Me

I expect you to be able to communicate issues that you have clearly. I do not want you feeling ovewhelemed or panicked during peak. If you need help or think that I am giving you too many responsibilities at once, please let me know.

### Weeding and Masking

I expect you to make a clear and honest attempt to communicate the requirements of the task, as applicable, to the weeding and masking team. We will have a person that will be a 'runner' of sorts that will be in charge of weeding and masking. this person will be your weeding and masking delegate. 

When you need a request relayed to the people that are weeding and masking, make sure that information is layed out clearly to the runner so that the runner can relay that information to the crew. If, for example, you have an order with the incorrect logo details, but they've been confirmed, you need to do let the runner know:
