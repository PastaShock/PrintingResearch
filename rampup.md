# Ramp up
Guidelines for the busy season
##  Introduction
### Expectations
I expect that we will maintain and enforce busy season rules as we approach the busy season
Those rules being:
- color coded orders
- marking reorders as urgent
- marking reprints
- communicating expectations to the next stages
- being on time to your shift
- managing your time efficiently
### Preface
Since the ramp up to the busy season is now happening, I need to make sure that my expectations are made clear and easily attainable. I will break things down by category and organize them based on how they come up in the process. I will explain further what needs to be done in an organized and hopefully descriptive manner.
## Starting the Day
### Timeliness
I expect you to show up on time and ready to work. I don't expect you to start printing right away, but within ten minutes of starting your shift (given there are printable orders in your queue).
### Queue
Your print queue is the printing stage on NetSuite, The reprint requests in the #reprints Slack channel and the banner requests in Jira.
I expect you to follow that order when looking for things to print.
### Order priority within NetSuite is as follows:
- Reorders
- Store orders
- Incentive/OTK and OTF
### Identifying orders
Reorders should always go in orange envelopes.
Orange sticky should also be attached especially in the case when a note needs to be attached by the printer (us).
Store orders will go in the yellow-green envelopes. Nothing else needs to be attached to identify them.
Incentive/OTK orders will go in the blue envelopes with no other identifiers.
OTF will go in green envelopes with no other identifiers.
